Really important lessons

I have managed to use active for the first time. On text active is pretty simple, you just select the <a> tag (or class or id) and change the colour when clicked.

a:active {
    color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}

On images it is a little more difficult, and I still haven't completely solved it. I have paced a :hover on images in a follow along tutorial, but I'm having trouble narrowing down the direct relationship that causes the transformation.
